# Arduino Board
Here we will be talking about the parts present in the Arduino UNO board.
USB connector -->Used to connect Pc to arduino to transfer codes
Power Port--> Used to provide power to the Arduino it can process AC/DC or even battery it has an maximum of 20V but only works in 5V due to the Voltage Regulator
Microcontroller--> Arduino uses at ATMEGA328P which has an flash memory of 32KB rom of 2KB and an miniature CPU to process codes.
Anolog Input pins--> It is present to take readings from analog sensors like an temp sensors and convert to digital values and measures voltage since very less current passses in them due to very high electricity.
Digital Pins-->Pins are detailed form 0 to 13 which can be used for giving input/output it produces 40mA at 5V
There are also some pins with ~3,~5,~6,~9,~10 and ~11 are normal digital pins which can be used for pulse width Modulation.
